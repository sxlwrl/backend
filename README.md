## How to run a project

<br/>First of all, you need to decide in which mode you want to run the project.<br/><br/>
If you want to run in ***developing mode*** then enter the following command:<br/><br/>

```
npm run dev
```

<br/>And if you want to run in ***production mode*** then enter the following command:<br/><br/>

```
npm run prod
```


<br/>*P.S. If you need to change any command, you can easily do so in package.json scripts*<br/><br/>
